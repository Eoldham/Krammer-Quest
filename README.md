# Krammer Quest

## Concept: 
In this game you have to navigate through a rogue-like maze, collecting bread and defeating 
monsters as you go. 

## Introduction:
Hello adventurer, welcome to the fantastic world of wefwef.It is a world full of evil monsters and items of great magical power.You have been searching around the ruins of a keep for an ancient idol. Suddenly the floor collapses and you fall into some buried chamber, dazed. When you regain your senses, you don't see the hole you fell into. Looking around, you see the room you are in is crumbling but well kept. There are lit torches in the walls and you see an eerie humanoid shadow. You have a strange feeling that the idol you're searching for is nearby... <br>

The world of Wefwef is full of monsters and seemingly endless rooms. The W key moves up, D moves right, A moves left, and S moves down.Wefwef can sense your uncertainty and wants to keep you safe from monsters.After every move, press enter to lock in and run your desired advancement. Be careful though, after every move of yours, the monsters move as well. Alphabetical characters denote monsters. You are represented by the @ symbol. '#' is a door forward and '^' is a door backward. '|' and '_' represent walls. You will be presented with several choices in the form of a menu. Change your selection with the WASD keys and confirm with the enter key. <br>

The old dungeon contains 20 rooms of varying construction.As you descend to the lower floors, you will be faced with increasingly dangerous enemies. Luckily, the ruins also contains equipment that can be repurposed for your survival. Food and medicine are aplenty, left behind by the late explorers that came before. Weapons left over from the old civilization are ready for you to use to defend yourself. Take up arms and slay the creatures of the dark to continue your descent safely. Treasure--like weapons and other item--is shown on the map by the '$' character. You can access and close your inventory by pressing I and equip/use items like a menu. The backspace key allows you to destroy items.<br> 

Be careful you don't throw away valuables! The monsters will not let you cut them down without a fight. If you encounter an enemy too strong for you to handle, you may want to run, lest you risk your demise. Keep in mind however that fleeing from a duel you requested is the mark of a coward and will not be permitted. You must train for the final showdown with the beast that guards the idol in order to claim it as your own.
